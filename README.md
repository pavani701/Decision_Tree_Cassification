# Decision_Tree_Classification

# Project Title:Prediction of iris.csv dataset for decision tree algorithm using supervised manchine learning algorithm .

# Probelm Statement:A American based botinical gardens a grow iris flower in their labs but using biotechnology in a single tree different types of varity flower is grow.As a datascience engineering find out how much accuarcy is their all categories contains same species.

# Impoert the libraries

# Load the Iris dataset

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets

# Create a Decision Tree classifier

# Train the classifier on the training data
